:::tip TL;DR

Each prop passed to `QueryBuilder` should have a stable reference or be memoized.

:::

As of version 7, all `QueryBuilder` props, components, and derived values are aggressively memoized with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and immutability tools including [`immer`](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/). This can noticeably improve rendering performance for large queries, especially when using certain style libraries. To take advantage of these optimizations, _every_ prop passed to `QueryBuilder` (except `query`, if used) must have a stable reference or at least be memoized. For related reasons, we encourage using `QueryBuilder` as an uncontrolled component by specifying `defaultQuery` instead of `query`.

## Avoiding common pitfalls

You can avoid unstable references by moving unchanging props, including object, array, and function definitions, outside the component rendering function. This commonly includes the `fields` array and `onQueryChange` callback. For props that _must_ be defined inside the component, memoize them with `useMemo` or `useCallback`. In particular, avoid defining props inline in the JSX.

- <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>DO</span> define variables that will remain
  unchanged outside the component if possible.
- <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>DO</span> memoize objects, arrays, and other
  values that must be created and/or calculated within the component with `useMemo`.
- <span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>DO</span> memoize functions that must be
  created within the component with `useCallback`.
- <span style={{ color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>DO NOT</span> define objects, arrays, or
  functions inside the JSX prop declarations (primitives like strings, numbers, and booleans are
  usually OK, though).

:::danger "Bad" example ❌

```tsx
function App() {
  const { t } = useTranslation(); // (<-- third-party i18n library)
  const [query, setQuery] = useState();

  // This function gets recreated on each render.
  const getOperators = (field: Field) => t(defaultOperators);

  return (
    <QueryBuilder
      // Avoid inline function definitions. Also see note below about `useState`/`useReducer`.
      onQueryChange={q => setQuery(q)}
      // Avoid inline array definitions, especially when the array will never change.
      fields={[
        { name: 'firstName', label: 'First Name' },
        { name: 'lastName', label: 'Last Name' },
      ]}
      // This function is not defined inline, but it still does not have a stable reference.
      getOperators={getOperators}
    />
  );
}
```

:::tip "Good" example ✅

```tsx
// The fields array never changes, so it can be defined outside the component.
const fields: Field[] = [
  { name: 'firstName', label: 'First Name' },
  { name: 'lastName', label: 'Last Name' },
];

function App() {
  const { t } = useTranslation(); // (<-- third-party i18n library)
  const [query, setQuery] = useState();

  // Memoize functions with `useCallback`. Since `t` (probably) has a
  // stable reference, this function will rarely (if ever) be recreated.
  const getOperators = useCallback((field: Field) => t(defaultOperators), [t]);

  return (
    <QueryBuilder
      // React `useState`/`useReducer` setters always have a stable reference.
      onQueryChange={setQuery}
      // This array is defined outside the component and therefore has a stable reference.
      fields={fields}
      // This function is memoized with `useCallback` and therefore has a stable reference.
      getOperators={getOperators}
    />
  );
}
```
